Assignments
============

The lecture will be held in person in the summer semester 2022, but all online resources will be available as well. We will supply also the problem sets every week to all students. The assignments come as a Jupyter Notebook, with individual problems. Please fill in the code or answers your are asked for and return the notebooks **before the lecture** every Tuesday morning. You will receive the web address of our assignment server as well as a login and password. Find also below a short video on how to download and return the assignments.
