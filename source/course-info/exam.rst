Exam
====

We will close this course with an exam in form of a final project. This final project shall be on a topic of your choice or on one of the topics we provide as example topics. Each individual student is required to hand in a Jupyter Notebook. No group work is allowed.

The final project is in the form of a **portfolio exam** as it consists of **two parts**, which will be equally weighted:

**1. Jupyter notebook containing the final project**

Notebooks shall follow the following outline

- **Introduction** You introduce into the problem your are covering with your notebook and motivate what your are going to do. The Introduction should also cover a basic theoretical description for the problem to be solved.
- **Results & Discussion** You develop the code for your problem and discuss and anotate the individual steps in your notebook. It is important the you discuss the individual results highlighting their consequences.
- **Summary** You summarize your findings.

Grading: Notebooks will be graded based on:

- structure of the notebook (outline, citations, ...)
- quality of the code (use of functions, classes, modules, function of the notebook)
- quality of the plots (axis labels, readability of the labels)

**2. Video explaining the notebook**

The videos shall 

- explain what topic you have chosen and why
- explain how you tackled the problem
- show the main results
- summarize what you think you have achieved
- be not longer than **5 min**

Grading: Videos will be graded based on:
    
- quality of the presentation (structure, oral and visual presentation)
- sticking to maximum time

The deadline for handing in the project is **1. September 2023** 

The projects and videos shall be handed in via the `Molecular Nanophotonics Website <https://home.uni-leipzig.de/~physik/sites/mona/>`_


Since many of you asked for some guiding topics abnd I as well hope that you do not submit a simulation of planetary motion, here are some topics, though some of them might be for the advanced physicist.


Mechanics
*********
- planetary motion (of course)
- the Brachistochrone, first find out what it is, and then simulate it
- N-coupled pendula and mechanical waves
- elastic/inelastic collisions 
- spinning top


Thermodynamics/Statistical Physics
**********************************
- ideal gas law from microscopic particle motions and wall collisions
- Maxwell deamon, find out what it is and simulate
- entropy from microstates
- Carnot cycle
- Vicsek model, find out what it is and simulate


Optics
******
- Caustics: ray tracing through spherical surfaces with paraxial approximation
- Caustics: ray tracing through spherical surfaces without paraxial approximation
- imaging errors, aberations 
- ray tracing of a prism with wavelength dependent refractive index
- light propagation though and optical fiber


Electrodynamics
***************
- thin film interference
- electromagnetic wave propagation through thin films (Fresnel coefficients)
- double slit experiment with light 
- grating diffraction, grating resolution
- scattering of an electron on a Coulomb potential (classical)
- array of freely rotating magnets

Quantum Mechanics
*****************
- wave packet in a periodic potential
- scattering of an electron on a coulomb potential (quantum mechanical)
