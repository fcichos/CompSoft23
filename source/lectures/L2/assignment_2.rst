Exercise 2
==========

Now that you are already pretty experienced with using the Jupyter notebook server we can contine with the second problemset. It is online and covers the topics

1. Numpy
2. Plotting
3. Random Numbers

The most interesting thing, though, is that we have an additional task at the end of the problemset. This is to challenge you, because we know that you like to be challenged.

As addition, we will also talk about making publication ready plots for your thesis or publication as an extra topic in the seminar after lecture 2.


Have fun!
