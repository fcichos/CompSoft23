Lecture Contents
================

In Lecture 9 we start to explore electromagnetic waves. We will not do that by solving a differential equation again, but by adding different electromagnetic waves. If you did not cover electromagnetic waves in other lectures, I hope you still can follow the calculations in the lecture.

1. Plane waves
2. Spherical waves
3. Huygens principle
4. Gaussian beams

I hope you stay motivated over time! Stay safe!
