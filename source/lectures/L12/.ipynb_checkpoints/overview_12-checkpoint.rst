Lecture Contents
================

In Lecture 12 we want close our considerations of different physical problems with a bit of hydrodynamics. We will do only simple things in this field, which introduce you to streamplots a bit. We will also start a new topic, which is Machine Learning. Since we can not cover a lot of ground there, we will restrict ourselves at some simpler algorithms like Reinforcement Learning this time and Neural Nets in the next lectures. s
