Lecture Contents
================

In this 7th lecture we will have some more examples from mechanics. But we will also enter the field of partial differential equations. We will solve the diffusion equation.

1. Spring Pendulum
2. Simple Planetary Motion
3. Diffusion Equation

As we have covered already a number of different ordinary differential equations, the first two topics will be only briefly covered. You want to extend them in you final project.
