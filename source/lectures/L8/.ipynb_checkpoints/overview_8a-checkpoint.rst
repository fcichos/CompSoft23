Lecture Contents
================

Lecture 8 will be probably the shortes, but yet one of the important ones. We have more or less our "Bergfest" today. Therefore, I wont stress you with 1.5 hours of video lecture but rather only 50 min. We will cover curve fitting

1. Curve fitting in Python
2. Least Squares
3. Covariances and Correlation 

In addition you will get an assignment which is related to the contens of the lecture. 
I hope you stay motivated! Stay safe!
