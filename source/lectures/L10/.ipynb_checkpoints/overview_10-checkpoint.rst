Lecture Contents
================

In Lecture 10 we want to cover some simpler problems of quantum mechanics. While we did not solve the wave equation for electromagnetic waves, we can now solve the Schr√∂dinger equation, which is equivalent to the Helmholtz equation for electomagnetic waves. We will start with a very brief introduction into the basics of quantum mechanics and then turn into specific problems.

1. Quantum mechanics primer
2. Particle in a box
3. Harmonic oscillator
4. Periodic potentials

I hope you stay motivated over time! Stay safe!
