Lecture Contents
================

In this 4th lecture we will have a look at 

1. Classes and Objects
2. Physics Project: Brownian Motion
3. Animations 


Note that the section on Animations will not show the final animations. I have added a short sequence at the end of the video. 
If you want to have a look at the animations, please use the Binder version of the lecture. The lecture notebooks may slightly deviate from the video and are subject to changes until the Lecture date.
