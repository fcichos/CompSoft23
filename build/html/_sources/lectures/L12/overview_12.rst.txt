Lecture Contents
================

In Lecture 12 you get something very special. You get a short introduction into a reactive notebook environment called **Pluto**. Pluto is a notebook system based on the 
programming language **Julia**. The main difference between Julia and Python is that the code is compiled in Julia while intepreted in Python. Thus Julia code runs typically much faster, actually as fast a C or C++. The special about Pluto is the reactivity. This means that every cells in Pluto can affect the execution of other cells. Thus changing a variable may cause the whole notebook to recalculate the results and plots. This may be very special at the beginning, but becomes quite useful.

I'm very glad that two students will be presenting this system to you. So thank you very much to Tomasz and Shashank!!!!

I hope you stay motivated! Stay safe!
